     * We are going to start study datastructure Array for coding interview
     * An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
     * This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value,
     * i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
     *
     * Advantage of using Arrays
     * Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
     * Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
